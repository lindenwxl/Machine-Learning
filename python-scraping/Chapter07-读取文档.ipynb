      "b'CHAPTER I\\n\\n\"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of theBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don\\'t tell me that this means war,if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated bythat Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will havenothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longermy \\'faithful slave,\\' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I seeI have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news.\"\\n\\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known AnnaPavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress MaryaFedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a manof high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at herreception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, asshe said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word inSt. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\\n\\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, anddelivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\\n\\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if theprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not tooterrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10-Annette Scherer.\"\\n\\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in theleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearingan embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and hadstars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spokein that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke butthought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to aman of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He wentup to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on thesofa.\\n\\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\\'smind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath thepoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and evenirony could be discerned.\\n\\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in timeslike these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You arestaying the whole evening, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador\\'s? Today is Wednesday. Imust put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter iscoming for me to take me there.\"\\n\\n\"I thought today\\'s fete had been canceled. I confess all thesefestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\\n\\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment wouldhave been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, byforce of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev\\'sdispatch? You know everything.\"\\n\\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold,listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided thatBuonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready toburn ours.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating astale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her fortyyears, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be anenthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when shedid not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not todisappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smilewhich, though it did not suit her faded features, always playedround her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continualconsciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, norcould, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\\n\\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovnaburst out:\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\\'t understandthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracioussovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That isthe one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has toperform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noblethat God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation andcrush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible thanever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone mustavenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we relyon?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannotunderstand the Emperor Alexander\\'s loftiness of soul. She hasrefused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, somesecret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.The English have not understood and cannot understand theself-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but onlydesires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! Andwhat little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia hasalways declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europeis powerless before him.... And I don\\'t believe a word that Hardenburgsays, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just atrap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adoredmonarch. He will save Europe!\"\\n\\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\\n\\n\"I think,\" said the prince with a smile, \"that if you had beensent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured theKing of Prussia\\'s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will yougive me a cup of tea?\"\\n\\n\"In a moment. A propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I amexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one ofthe best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the goodones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? Hehas been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\"he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurredto him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motiveof his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funketo be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accountsis a poor creature.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but otherswere trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure itfor the baron.\\n\\nAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither shenor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired orwas pleased with.\\n\\n\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by hersister,\" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\\n\\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna\\'s face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show BaronFunke beaucoup d\\'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\\n\\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with thewomanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, AnnaPavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done ofa man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,so she said:\\n\\n\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter cameout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazinglybeautiful.\"\\n\\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\\n\\n\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearerto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show thatpolitical and social topics were ended and the time had come forintimate conversation- \"I often think how unfairly sometimes thejoys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendidchildren? I don\\'t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don\\'t likehim,\" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising hereyebrows. \"Two such charming children. And really you appreciatethem less than anyone, and so you don\\'t deserve to have them.\"\\n\\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help it,\" said the prince. \"Lavater would have said Ilack the bump of paternity.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know Iam dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\" (and herface assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at HerMajesty\\'s and you were pitied....\"\\n\\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,awaiting a reply. He frowned.\\n\\n\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did alla father could for their education, and they have both turned outfools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an activeone. That is the only difference between them.\" He said this smilingin a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinklesround his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarseand unpleasant.\\n\\n\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not afather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\" said AnnaPavlovna, looking up pensively.\\n\\n\"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. Thatis how I explain it to myself. It can\\'t be helped!\"\\n\\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.\\n\\n\"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\"she asked. \"They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, andthough I don\\'t feel that weakness in myself as yet,I know a littleperson who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation ofyours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memoryand perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by amovement of the head that he was considering this information.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" he said at last, evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts, \"that Anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year? And,\" he went on after a pause, \"what will it be infive years, if he goes on like this?\" Presently he added: \"That\\'s whatwe fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?\"\\n\\n\"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. Heis the well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the armyunder the late Emperor, and was nicknamed \\'the King of Prussia.\\' He isvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is veryunhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married LiseMeinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov\\'s and will be heretonight.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, dear Annette,\" said the prince, suddenly taking AnnaPavlovna\\'s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \"Arrangethat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe wigh an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. Sheis rich and of good family and that\\'s all I want.\"\\n\\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raisedthe maid of honor\\'s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to andfro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\\n\\n\"Attendez,\" said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, \"I\\'ll speak to Lise,young Bolkonski\\'s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing canbe arranged. It shall be on your family\\'s behalf that I\\'ll start myapprenticeship as old maid.\"'\n"

      "«Si vous n'avez rien de mieux à faire, Monsieur le comte (или mon prince), et si la perspective de passer la soirée chez une pauvre malade ne vous effraye pas trop, je serai charmée de vous voir chez moi entre 7 et 10 heures. Annette Scherer».\n",
      "— Dieu, quelle virulente sortie! — отвечал, нисколько не смутясь такою встречей, вошедший князь, в придворном, шитом мундире, в чулках, башмаках и звездах, с светлым выражением плоского лица.\n",
      "Он говорил на том изысканном французском языке, на котором не только говорили, но и думали наши деды, и с теми, тихими, покровительственными интонациями, которые свойственны состаревшемуся в свете и при дворе значительному человеку. Он подошел к Анне Павловне, поцеловал ее руку, подставив ей свою надушенную и сияющую лысину, и покойно уселся на диване.\n",
      "— Avant tout dites-moi, comment vous allez, chère amie? Успокойте меня, — сказал он, не изменяя голоса и тоном, в котором из-за приличия и участия просвечивало равнодушие и даже насмешка.\n",
      "— Как можно быть здоровой... когда нравственно страдаешь? Разве можно, имея чувство, оставаться спокойною в наше время? — сказала Анна Павловна. — Вы весь вечер у меня, надеюсь?\n",
      "— А праздник английского посланника? Нынче середа. Мне надо показаться там, — сказал князь. — Дочь заедет за мной и повезет меня.\n",
      "— Я думала, что нынешний праздник отменен, Je vous avoue que toutes ces fêtes et tous ces feux d'artifice commencent à devenir insipides.\n",
      "— Ежели бы знали, что вы этого хотите, праздник бы отменили, — сказал князь по привычке, как заведенные часы, говоря вещи, которым он и не хотел, чтобы верили.\n",
      "— Ne me tourmentez pas. Eh bien, qu'a-t-on décidé par rapport à la dépêche de Novosilzoff? Vous savez tout.\n",
      "— Как вам сказать? — сказал князь холодным, скучающим тоном. — Qu'a-t-on décidé? On a décidé que Buonaparte a brûlé ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de brûler les nôtres.\n",
      "Князь Василий говорил всегда лениво, как актер говорит роль старой пиесы. Анна Павловна Шерер, напротив, несмотря на свои сорок лет, была преисполнена оживления и порывов.\n",
      "Быть энтузиасткой сделалось ее общественным положением, и иногда, когда ей даже того не хотелось, она, чтобы не обмануть ожиданий людей, знавших ее, делалась энтузиасткой. Сдержанная улыбка, игравшая постоянно на лице Анны Павловны, хотя и не шла к ее отжившим чертам, выражала, как у избалованных детей, постоянное сознание своего милого недостатка, от которого она не хочет, не может и не находит нужным исправляться.\n",
      "В середине разговора про политические действия Анна Павловна разгорячилась.\n",
      "— Ах, не говорите мне про Австрию! Я ничего не понимаю, может быть, но Австрия никогда не хотела и не хочет войны. Она предает нас. Россия одна должна быть спасительницей Европы. Наш благодетель знает свое высокое призвание и будет верен ему. Вот одно, во что я верю. Нашему доброму и чудному государю предстоит величайшая роль в мире, и он так добродетелен и хорош, что Бог не оставит его, и он исполнит свое призвание задавить гидру революции, которая теперь еще ужаснее в лице этого убийцы и злодея. Мы одни должны искупить кровь праведника. На кого нам надеяться, я вас спрашиваю?.. Англия с своим коммерческим духом не поймет и не может понять всю высоту души императора Александра. Она отказалась очистить Мальту. Она хочет видеть, ищет заднюю мысль наших действий. Что они сказали Новосильцеву? Ничего. Они не поняли, они не могли понять самоотвержения нашего императора, который ничего не хочет для себя и все хочет для блага мира. И что они обещали? Ничего. И что обещали, и того не будет! Пруссия уже объявила, что Бонапарте непобедим и что вся Европа ничего не может против него... И я не верю ни в одном слове ни Гарденбергу, ни Гаугвицу. Cette fameuse neutralité prussienne, ce n'est qu'un piège. Я верю в одного Бога и в высокую судьбу нашего милого императора. Он спасет Европу!.. — Она вдруг остановилась с улыбкой насмешки над своею горячностью.\n",
      "— Я думаю, — сказал князь, улыбаясь, — что, ежели бы вас послали вместо нашего милого Винценгероде, вы бы взяли приступом согласие прусского короля. Вы так красноречивы. Вы дадите мне чаю?\n",
      "— Сейчас. A propos, — прибавила она, опять успокоиваясь, — нынче у меня два очень интересные человека, le vicomte de Mortemart, il est allié aux Montmorency par les Rohans, одна из лучших фамилий Франции. Это один из хороших эмигрантов, из настоящих. И потом l'abbé Morio; вы знаете этот глубокий ум? Он был принят государем. Вы знаете?\n",
      "— А! Я очень рад буду, — сказал князь. — Скажите, — прибавил он, как будто только что вспомнив что-то и особенно-небрежно, тогда как то, о чем он спрашивал, было главной целью его посещения, — правда, что l'impératrice-mère желает назначения барона Функе первым секретарем в Вену? C'est un pauvre sire, ce baron, à ce qu'il paraît. — Князь Василий желал определить сына на это место, которое через императрицу Марию Феодоровну старались доставить барону.\n",
      "Анна Павловна почти закрыла глаза в знак того, что ни она, ни кто другой не могут судить про то, что угодно или нравится императрице.\n",
      "— Monsieur le baron de Funke a été recommandé à l'impératrice-mère par sa sur, — только сказала она грустным, сухим тоном. В то время как Анна Павловна назвала императрицу, лицо ее вдруг представило глубокое и искреннее выражение преданности и уважения, соединенное с грустью, что с ней бывало каждый раз, когда она в разговоре упоминала о своей высокой покровительнице. Она сказала, что ее величество изволила оказать барону Функе beaucoup d'estime, и опять взгляд ее подернулся грустью.\n",
      "Князь равнодушно замолк, Анна Павловна, с свойственною ей придворною и женскою ловкостью и быстротою такта, захотела и щелкануть князя за то, что он дерзнул так отозваться о лице, рекомендованном императрице, и в то же время утешить его.\n",
      "— Mais à propos de votre famille, — сказала она, — знаете ли, что ваша дочь, с тех пор как выезжает, fait les délices de tout le monde. On la trouve belle comme le jour.\n",
      "Князь наклонился в знак уважения и признательности.\n",
      "— Я часто думаю, — продолжала Анна Павловна после минутного молчания, придвигаясь к князю и ласково улыбаясь ему, как будто выказывая этим, что политические и светские разговоры кончены и теперь начинается задушевный, — я часто думаю, как иногда несправедливо распределяется счастие жизни. За что вам дала судьба таких двух славных детей (исключая Анатоля, вашего меньшого, я его не люблю, — вставила она безапелляционно, приподняв брови), — таких прелестных детей? А вы, право, менее всех цените их и потому их не сто́ите.\n",
      "И она улыбнулась своею восторженной улыбкой.\n",
      "— Que voulez-vous? Lafater aurait dit que je n'ai pas la bosse de la paternité, — сказал князь.\n",
      "— Перестаньте шутить. Я хотела серьезно поговорить с вами. Знаете, я недовольна вашим меньшим сыном. Между нами будь сказано (лицо ее приняло грустное выражение), о нем говорили у ее величества и жалеют вас...\n",
      "Князь не отвечал, но она молча, значительно глядя на него, ждала ответа. Князь Василий поморщился.\n",
      "— Что ж мне делать? — сказал он наконец. — Вы знаете, я сделал для их воспитания все, что может отец, и оба вышли des imbéciles. Ипполит, по крайней мере, покойный дурак, а Анатоль — беспокойный. Вот одно различие, — сказал он, улыбаясь более неестественно и одушевленно, чем обыкновенно, и при этом особенно резко выказывая в сложившихся около его рта морщинах что-то неожиданно-грубое и неприятное.\n",
      "— И зачем родятся дети у таких людей, как вы? Ежели бы вы не были отец, я бы ни в чем не могла упрекнуть вас, — сказала Анна Павловна, задумчиво поднимая глаза.\n",
      "— Je suis votre верный раб, et à vous seule je puis l'avouer. Мои дети — ce sont les entraves de mon existence. Это мой крест. Я так себе объясняю. Que voulez-vous?..— Он помолчал, выражая жестом свою покорность жестокой судьбе.\n",
      "Анна Павловна задумалась.\n",
      "— Вы никогда не думали о том, чтобы женить вашего блудного сына Анатоля. Говорят, — сказала она, — что старые девицы ont la manie des mariages. Я еще не чувствую за собою этой слабости, но у меня есть одна petite personne, которая очень несчастлива с отцом, une parente à nous, une princesse Болконская. — Князь Василий не отвечал, хотя с свойственной светским людям быстротой соображения и памятью движением головы показал, что он принял к соображению это сведенье.\n",
      "— Нет, вы знаете ли, что этот Анатоль мне стоит сорок тысяч в год, — сказал он, видимо не в силах удерживать печальный ход своих мыслей. Он помолчал.\n",
      "— Что будет через пять лет, ежели это пойдет так? Voilà l'avantage d'être père. Она богата, ваша княжна?\n",
      "— Отец очень богат и скуп. Он живет в деревне. Знаете, этот известный князь Болконский, отставленный еще при покойном императоре и прозванный прусским королем. Он очень умный человек, но со странностями и тяжелый. La pauvre petite est malheureuse comme les pierres. У нее брат, вот что недавно женился на Lise Мейнен, адъютант Кутузова. Он будет нынче у меня.\n",
      "— Ecoutez, chère Annette, — сказал князь, взяв вдруг свою собеседницу за руку и пригибая ее почему-то книзу. — Arrangez-moi cette affaire et je suis votre вернейший раб à tout jamais (рап — comme mon староста m'écrit des донесенья: покой-ер-п). Она хорошей фамилии и богата. Все, что мне нужно.\n",
      "И он с теми свободными и фамильярными грациозными движениями, которые его отличали, взял за руку фрейлину, поцеловал ее и, поцеловав, помахал фрейлинскою рукой, развалившись на креслах и глядя в сторону.\n",
      "— Attendez, — сказала Анна Павловна, соображая. — Я нынче же поговорю Lise (la femme du jeune Болконский). И, может быть, это уладится. Ce sera dans votre famille que je ferai mon apprentissage de vieille fille.\n"

      "Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[29] and its implementation began in December 1989[30] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL)[31] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[7] Van Rossum remains Python's principal author. His continuing central role in Python's development is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).\n",
      "On the origins of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "...In December 1989, I was looking for a \"hobby\" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).\n",
      "— Guido van Rossum\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release, the development process became more transparent and community-backed.[33]\n",
      "Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on 3 December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions.[34] However, many of its major features have been backported to the Python 2.6.x[35] and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[36]\n",
      "Python 2.7's end-of-life date (a.k.a. EOL, sunset date) was initially set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[37][38]\n",
      "Python 3.6 had changes regarding UTF-8 (in Windows, PEP 528 and PEP 529) and Python 3.7.0b1 (PEP 540) adds a new \"UTF-8 Mode\" (and overrides POSIX locale).\n",
      "In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads.[39]\n",
      "Features and philosophy[edit]\n",
      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[40] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[41] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[42][43] and logic programming.[44]\n",
      "Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter(), map(), and reduce() functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, and sets; and generator expressions.[45] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[46]\n",
      "The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[47]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful is better than ugly\n",
      "Explicit is better than implicit\n",
      "Simple is better than complex\n",
      "Complex is better than complicated\n",
      "Readability counts\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[29]\n",
      "While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of Perl) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As Alex Martelli put it: \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[48] Python's philosophy rejects the Perl \"there is more than one way to do it\" approach to language design in favor of \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\".[47]\n",
      "Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[49] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\n",
      "An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[50]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[51][52]\n",
      "A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.\n",
      "Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas, and Pythoneers.[53][54]\n",
      "Syntax and semantics[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics\n",
      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[55]\n",
      "Indentation[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[56] This feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule.\n",
      "Statements and control flow[edit]\n",
      "Python's statements include (among others):\n",
      "\n",
      "The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to \"typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2\". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to \"(generic) name x receives a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2.\" This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.\n",
      "The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).\n",
      "The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.\n",

From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[63]\n",
      "Expressions[edit]\n",
      "Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:\n",
      "\n",
      "Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division and integer division.[64] Python also added the ** operator for exponentiation.\n",
      "From Python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[65][66]\n",
      "In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[67] and objects by reference.[68] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.\n",
      "Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.\n",
      "Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.[45]\n",
      "Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.\n",
      "Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[69] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\n",
      "Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[70]\n",
      "Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[citation needed]\n",
      "Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'.[71]\n",
      "Python has various kinds of string literals:\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[71]\n",
      "Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.\n",
      "Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "List comprehensions vs. for-loops\n",
      "Conditional expressions vs. if blocks\n",
      "The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\n",
      "Methods[edit]\n",
      "Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).[72]\n",
      "Typing[edit]\n",
      "Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\n",
      "Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\n",
      "Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[73] The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.\n",
      "The long term plan is to support gradual typing[74] and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[75]\n",

It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a new matrix multiply @ operator is included in version 3.5.[77] Additionally, it has a unary operator (~), which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument. For integers, this means ~x=-x-1.[78] Other operators include bitwise shift operators x << y, which shifts x to the left y places, the same as x*(2**y) , and x >> y, which shifts x to the right y places, the same as x/(2**y) .[79]\n",
      "The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[80]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2.\n",
      "Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator is introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).\n",

      "\n",
      "Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[81]\n",
      "Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[82] Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) is 2, round(2.5) is 2.[83]\n",
      "Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[84][page needed]\n",
      "Python has extensive built-in support for arbitrary precision arithmetic. Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), belonging to the python type int, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the python type long, where needed. The latter have an \"L\" suffix in their textual representation.[85] (In Python 3, the distinction between the int and long types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the int class.) The Decimal type/class in module decimal (since version 2.4) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[86] The Fraction type in module fractions (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[87]\n",

SageMath is a mathematical software with a \"notebook\" programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. The Python language re-implemented in Java platform is used for numeric and statistical calculations with 2D/3D visualization by the DMelt project.[129][130]\n",
      "Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP,[131] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[132] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS.[133] It has also been used in several video games,[134][135] and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.[136] Python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance.[137] Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.[138]\n",
      "Python has been used in artificial intelligence projects.[139][140][141][142] As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.[143]\n",
      "Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and macOS, and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.\n",
      "Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.[144][145]\n",
      "Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python.[146]\n",
      "The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.\n",
      "LibreOffice includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[147] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.\n",
      "Languages influenced by Python[edit]\n",
      "Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:\n",
      "\n",
      "Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.[148]\n",
      "Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its \"Acknowledgements\" document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.[149] However, Cobra directly supports design-by-contract, unit tests, and optional static typing.[150]\n",
      "CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.\n",
      "ECMAScript borrowed iterators, generators and list comprehensions from Python.[151]\n",
      "Go is described as incorporating the \"development speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\".[152]\n",
      "Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java.[153]\n",
      "Julia was designed \"with true macros [.. and to be] as usable for general programming as Python [and] should be as fast as C\".[22] Calling to or from Julia is possible; to with PyCall.jl and a Python package pyjulia allows calling, in the other direction, from Python.\n",
      "Kotlin (programming language) is a functional programming language with an interactive shell similar to python. However, Kotlin is strongly typed with access to standard Java libraries.[154]\n",
      "OCaml has an optional syntax named twt (The Whitespace Thing), inspired by Python and Haskell.[155]\n",
      "Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: \"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language.\"[156]\n",
      "Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.[157]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl[158] and Erlang.[159]\n",
      "Python received TIOBE's Programming Language of the Year awards in 2007 and 2010. The award is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the year, as measured by the TIOBE index.[160]\n",
