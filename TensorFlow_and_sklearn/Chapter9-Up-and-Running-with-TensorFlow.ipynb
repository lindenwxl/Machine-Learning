    "TensorFlow was designed to be flexible, scalable, and production-ready, and existing frameworks\n",
    "arguably hit only two out of the three of these. Here are some of TensorFlow’s highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It runs not only on Windows, Linux, and macOS, but also on mobile devices,including both iOS and Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides a very simple Python API called TF.Learn2 (tensorflow.contrib.learn), compatible with Scikit-Learn. As you will see, you can use it to train various types of neural networks in just a few lines of code. It was previously an independent project called Scikit Flow (or skflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also provides another simple API called TF-slim (tensorflow.contrib.slim)to simplify building, training, and evaluating neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Several other high-level APIs have been built independently on top of Tensor‐Flow, such as Keras or Pretty Tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its main Python API offers much more flexibility (at the cost of higher complexity)to create all sorts of computations, including any neural network architecture you can think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It includes highly efficient C++ implementations of many ML operations, particularly those needed to build neural networks. There is also a C++ API to define your own high-performance operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides several advanced optimization nodes to search for the parameters that minimize a cost function. These are very easy to use since TensorFlow automatically takes care of computing the gradients of the functions you define. This is called automatic differentiating (or autodiff).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also comes with a great visualization tool called TensorBoard that allows you to browse through the computation graph, view learning curves, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Google also launched a cloud service to run TensorFlow graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Last but not least, it has a dedicated team of passionate and helpful developers,and a growing community contributing to improving it. It is one of the most popular open source projects on GitHub, and more and more great projects are being built on top of it (for examples, check out the resources page on https://www.tensorflow.org/, or https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow). To ask technical questions, you should use http://stackoverflow.com/ and tag your question with \"tensorflow\". You can file bugs and feature requests through GitHub.For general discussions, join the Google group."
